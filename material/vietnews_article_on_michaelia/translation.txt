OVER HALF A MILLION PEOPLE HAVE THEIR BENEFITS CUT BY CENTRELINK

Approximately 580,000 unemployed people in Australia under the Jobactive program have had their welfare benefits suspended in the past fiscal year.

This is due to the unemployed not seeking jobs, not attending interviews, or behaving improperly during interviews, according to data released by Federal Employment Minister Michaelia Cash.

The total amount of benefits temporarily suspended for the unemployed has exceeded $2 million in the past 12 months, and many people receiving benefits have repeatedly violated.
In fact, more than 60,000 people have had their benefits suspended more than ten times within a year, as of July 2019. The Daily Telegraph reported, notably, one benefit recipient had their benefits suspended up to 52 times.

Job seekers in the Jobactive program must meet mandatory conditions, such as regularly attending interviews and submitting 20 job applications each month.

The unemployed receive Newstart allowance, the main source of income supporting them in their job search. Newstart allowance is paid every two weeks. In which, single people can receive up to $555.57, while single parents receive up to $601.10.

However, if the conditions are not met, the benefits will be reduced, suspended, or completely cut off.

Minister Cash said, the Coalition is “seriously considering the implementation of obligations of benefit recipients”.

“When the unemployed have their benefits suspended up to 52 times in less than a year, it means they are not acting as taxpayers expect, even though they are being supported by the government in difficult times,” the Minister said.
